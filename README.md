# Nav Bar Issue

This code is a simple [Ionic mobile app](https://ionicframework.com/) that displays an issue that I need help tackling.  This code is not meant to be used in production.

## Get Started

Simply clone the code on your computer.  Once you have the code, using a terminal, change to the root directory.  Then install all required libraries with `npm install`.  Finally run `npx ionic serve` to get it running in the local browser.
